The Proxy Design Pattern essentially introduces an intermediary class (the proxy) that controls access to the
original class (the real subject). This allows you to add additional functionality or manage certain aspects
without modifying the original class

Example of use:

Lazy Initialization (Virtual Proxy): Delay the creation and initialization of an expensive object until it is actually needed.
